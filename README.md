## Rich Text Editor

The application leverages TinyMCE, providing an intuitive and powerful rich text editing experience. Users can format text, insert multimedia elements, and craft engaging articles akin to professional word processors.

## Appwrite Integration

Appwrite serves as the backbone, streamlining backend operations and enhancing the security of user authentication and data storage. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API, allowing developers to build secure apps faster.Appwrite plays a pivotal role in implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the BlogIt application, ensuring secure and streamlined user access management. Appwrite provides an in-built authentication and authorization system that simplifies defining roles, permissions, and access levels for different types of users.

In BlogIt, Appwrite’s RBAC features are utilized as follows:

User Authentication: Secure signup and login mechanisms are implemented using Appwrite's authentication APIs, ensuring that only verified users can access the platform.

Custom Roles and Permissions: Appwrite allows defining roles such as Admin, Author, and Reader. Each role has specific permissions:

Admin: Full access, including managing all user accounts, articles, and system settings.
Author: Can create, edit, and delete their own articles.
Reader: Can browse and read articles but cannot modify or create content.
Access Control for Collections: Appwrite’s database integrates seamlessly with RBAC to restrict access to specific collections (e.g., articles, user profiles). For instance:

Authors can only modify their articles.
Readers can only view published articles.
Granular Permissions: Using Appwrite’s permission model, individual actions (e.g., reading, writing, deleting) are defined for users and roles. Permissions can also be assigned dynamically, ensuring flexibility.

This RBAC system, powered by Appwrite, ensures that users only access and perform actions aligned with their roles, enhancing security and operational efficiency in BlogIt.
